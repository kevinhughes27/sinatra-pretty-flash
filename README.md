Sinatra-Pretty-Flash
====================

A simple gem that adds decent styled flash messages to a Sinatra app.

Why?
----

While prototyping some things out in Sinatra I wanted a simple but decent looking flash message. I guess I was just used to our pretty awesome eco-system at work but I was surprised at how much code I'd need to add to have a nice looking flash message. Anyways I didn't want all that code in my prototype so I made this gem.
